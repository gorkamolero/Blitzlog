## ASSIGNMENT #4:

1) INITIAL SETUP

cd Blitzlog

sudo rm -rf node_modules
sudo rm -rf server/node_modules
sudo rm -rf web/node_modules


2) create User + Post schemas and models

3) save 3 user models to the User collection (fields: firstName, lastName, + additional u want)

4) save many post models and for each add a field called `userId`, which has the field of `user._id`

5) make a page at url /users which gets users from /api/users, loop through the users and display
them like you did posts

6) on /user/:slug ping /api/posts/:userSlug and get all posts for the given user.

Then, bi-directionally translate first + last names to/from slugs like this:

"James Gillmore" <=> 'james-gillmore' and search the User collection for:

const user = await User.findOne({ firstName: 'James', lastName: 'Gillmore' })
const posts await Post.find({ userId: user._id })
res.json(posts)


BONUS A: on /post/:slug display the user's name
BONUS B: when visiting /post/:slug directly, also show the user's name, by making /api/post/:slug find the post and the user that created it!

PART II)

learn https://emotion.sh

start making your own widget library. Start with these custom designed elements:


<Navbar />
<Sidebar>
<Card> // main content will end up going here
<MainContent />

<Input>
<Select> --> dropdown: published/draft
<Button>

<Header> // this is like h1
<Caption> // this like is like h2, u get the idea, improvise




We'll be working with forms next week. Pretend like you're making your own set of emotion-based React components to build standard web panels (perhaps that will become the basis of your CMS). Styles should look like this:

or more modern if you're hip to the latest trends.

Try to use the js-version of Emotion, rather than the strings.
